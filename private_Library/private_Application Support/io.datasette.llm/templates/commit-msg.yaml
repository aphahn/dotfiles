  Write a `git` commit message for all the diffs according to the following rules:
  - Look at all the diffs, not just the first one, when coming up with your message.
  - The first line should be a capitalized, short summary. It must be 50 characters or fewer.
  - The body should contain more detailed explanatory text, if necessary. It should appear after a blank line after the first line. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the two together.
  - Write your commit message in the imperative ("Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug"). This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.
  - Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
  - Bullet points are okay, too. Use a hyphen for the bullet, followed by a single space.
